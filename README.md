# Easi-ML
Someone is struggling with highly-specialized machine learning concepts and toolkits, while someone is giving up at the first glance of complicated programming language. 

Leading engineers try to build up Auto-ML systems, where models are trained and tuned by themselves. 

However, it is a pity for anyone interested in bringing up his/her own baby models. 

Please remind that we enjoy making Lego even if the civil engineering has incredibly highly developed. 

Please remind that we enjoy grilling chicken wings even if you can order any dish via a simple phone call. 

We call Easi-ML an ART, not a PROJECT. 

# Easi-ML Goals
Easi-ML extracts common used components from popular toolkits to help non-knowledge users as building bricks for your machine learning arts.

Easi-ML highly reduces programming efforts for people who do not understand Computer Science: students, mathematician, self-business owners, emerging business explorers, ML lovers.
