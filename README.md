# Run:
v1.0:
  pipline
    preprocessing.py : transform datasets, eg. drop NaN, onehot for cat, normalization etc. 
    fitting.py : models for fitting, supervised learning only. 
    framework.py : workflow using prepare and fitting. Full modelling work is predefined, transparent to user. Therefore, user parameters merely control the functionality other than fitting techniques.
    demo_titanic.py : train and select model for Titanic Survival dataset. Predict Survival or not. 
    
    tensorflow0.py : trying to add neural network to extend fitting functions, to be completed yet. 
  data
    state-of-art datasets for tranditional machine learning cases (no image or text data invovled, from kaggle site)
  output
    the selected best model for the dataset. 
  util 
    some global helpers. 

v0:
  bullshit

test:
  trying something new. like Q-learning, tensorflow etc. 


# Easi-ML Value
Someone are struggling with highly specialized machine learning concepts and tool-kits, while someone are giving up at the first glance of complicated programming language. 

Some leading engineers try to build up Auto-ML systems, where models are trained and tuned all by themselves. 

However, it is really a pity for anyone insterested in bringing up his/her own baby models. 

Please remind that we still enjoy making Lego even if the civil engineering has incredibly higly develped. 

Please remind that we still enjoy grilling chicken wings even if you can order any dish via a simple phone call. 

We call it ART, but not PROJECT. 

Easi-ML extracts common used components from popular tool kits to help non-knowledge users as building bricks for your machine learning arts.

Easi-ML highly reduce your programming efforts for who have no sense of computer science: students, mathematician, self business owners, emerging business explorers, ML true lovers.
